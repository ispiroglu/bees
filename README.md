# This project is an implementation of Worker (Goroutine, Thread...) Pools

### Motivation
At my other project [mercurius](github.com/ispiroglu/mercurius), I needed a structure for multiple goroutines to listen exact same channel. So I'm implementing a worker pool rn :)

And yes, I named this little worker pool as bees because bees are hardworking so why not :)
